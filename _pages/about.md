I am an incoming Master's student in Biotatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto (UofT). I just obtained my B.Sc. in Statistics and Mathematics also from UofT. 

My studies began with a focus on mathematics, but it was the practical applications of statistics that truly captured my interest. Through internships, and research positions, I discovered how statistical methods provided powerful, real-world insights across many fields. This became even more clear in my upper-year studies, where I saw firsthand the impact of statistics on projects in psychology, environmental sciences and, most recently, health.

I am currently working at the ReSTORE Lab under the supervision of Dr. Nowrouzi-Kia through the Data Sciences Institute and Women's College Hospital under the supervision of Dr. David Lim through the Institute of Medical Sciences.
