I am an incoming Master's student in Biotatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto (UofT). I just obtained my B.Sc. in Statistics and Mathematics also from UofT. I am highly interested in the applications of machine learning to biomedical research, particularly in the field of risk prediction for chronic conditions.  

This past summer, I worked at the [ReSTORE Lab](https://www.restore.rehab/) under the supervision of Dr. Nowrouzi-Kia through the Data Sciences Institute and Women's College Hospital under the supervision of Dr. David Lim through the Institute of Medical Sciences.
