## RESEARCH PROJECTS  
**NLP Project: Detection of spam YouTube comments**  
*STA314: Statistical Methods for Machine Learning I*  
*September – December 2024*  
- Developed a machine learning classifier to automatically detect and flag spam comments on YouTube using a dataset of 1,369 labeled comments.  
- Used semantic analysis and BERT, an ensemble model using majority voting classifying.  
- Implemented XGBoost, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to achieve an accuracy of over 95%.  

**Spatiotemporal Data Project: Modeling Suicide Incidence in California**  
*STA465: Spatial Data Analysis*  
*September – December 2024*  
- Analyzed suicide rates across California's counties using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and Bayesian hierarchical spatiotemporal models, using proximity to alcohol outlets, access to parks, and the number of mental health clinics.  
- Spatial autocorrelation was assessed with Moran’s I, and INLA was used to estimate relative risks.  
- Performed spatial joins to merge datasets.  

**Applied Relative Belief Project**  
*STA497: Readings in Statistics*
