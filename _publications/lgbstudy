title: "The Differential Roles of Minority Stressors in LGB Identity Disclosure"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'In this study, we examine how minority stressors (i.e., everyday discrimination, felt stigma, and internalized stigma) jointly contribute to sexual orientation disclosure. To do so, we use a national probability sample of 944 LGB adults and two distinct measures of disclosure (i.e., outness and disclosure behavior). We then compared four different path models that capture the relationships between minority stressors and disclosure. Among the two supported models, we find that 1) outness is best predicted by internalized stigma, and disclosure behavior is best predicted by everyday discrimination, and 2) everyday discrimination indirectly predicts both disclosure outcomes through increasing felt stigma and internalized stigma. In sum, this work suggests that everyday discrimination is the beginning of a cascade in sexual orientation disclosure, which provides an important theoretical contribution in understanding how minority stress relates to disclosure as well as implications for social actions.'
