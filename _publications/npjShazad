Abstract

Skilled trades workers, including electricians, face unique occupational stressors and a persistent labour shortage that may contribute to burnout, job dissatisfaction, and heightened intention to leave (ITL). This cross-sectional study of 73 electricians aimed to assess the prevalence of burnout, job satisfaction, and ITL and to explore the relationships between these factors while accounting for sociodemographic and occupational characteristics. Burnout (measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), was prevalent (31.8%) but not independently associated with ITL. Higher job satisfaction (measured using an adapted NIOSH Generic Job Stress Questionnaire) was linked to lower ITL (OR = 0.58, 95% CI [0.34, 0.96]). Apprentice status significantly increased the odds of ITL (OR = 6.59, 95% CI [1.48, 38.47]). Findings suggest that job satisfaction is a protective factor against turnover intention, while apprentices are at a greater risk of ITL - underscoring the need for targeted retention and mental health strategies in the skilled trades.
