Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease causing unpredictable flares and multiorgan irreversible damage, often leading to functional decline. About 20-40% of patients exit the workforce prematurely due to disability, unemployment, or mortality, resulting in financial and psychological strain. This study developed an interpretable LSTM model to identify high-risk patients early, enabling timely interventions like treatment adjustments or workplace accommodations. The model was able to flag 89% of future disability cases with a median lead time of 28.6 months
