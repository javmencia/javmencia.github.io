*Poster presentation at SURP Research Day.*  



Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a rare but aggressive form of breast cancer that lacks three key receptors (estrogen, progesterone, and HER2), leaving fewer treatment options and placing systemic therapy as the cornerstone of treatment. However, histologic differences between invasive ductal (IDC) versus lobular (ILC) carcinoma may challenge this approach.
